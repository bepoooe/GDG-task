# GDG Task: AI-Driven GitHub Repository Insights Dashboard

This repository contains my code for a sophisticated dashboard that provides deep, AI-driven insights into any public GitHub repository.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a web dashboard that analyzes any public GitHub repository and presents meaningful, actionable insights powered by AI.  
This tool is designed to help developers, maintainers, and organizations better understand repository activity, code quality, community engagement, and more.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses machine learning and natural language processing to extract patterns and actionable insights from repository data.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks stars, forks, issues, pull requests, contributors, commit activity, and release history.
- **Code Quality Assessment**: Evaluates code health, detects potential technical debt, and highlights areas for improvement.
- **Community Engagement**: Analyzes discussions, issue responsiveness, and contributor interactions.
- **Visualization**: Presents data through interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards for easy interpretation.
- **Customizable Reports**: Generate PDF/Markdown reports summarizing repository status and recommendations.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Enter the URL or owner/name of any public GitHub repository.
2. **Data Fetching**: The dashboard fetches repository metadata, commit history, issues, pull requests, and other relevant data using the GitHub API.
3. **AI Analysis**: Runs models to extract insights, trends, anomalies, and provides recommendations.
4. **Visualization**: Displays findings in an intuitive interface.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript 
- GitHub REST & GraphQL APIs
- React
- Data Visualization (Chart.js)
- Vercel (for easy deployment)

## Getting Started
